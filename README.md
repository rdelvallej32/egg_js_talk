# Egg.js Talk

Easter eggs are fun, and I want to show you how to use
Egg.js' simple JS library on how to add web easter eggs by watching the user's keystrokes.

## Objectves

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

-   Reference the Egg.js library.
-   Implement Egg.js in a project.
-   Add easter eggs within a web application.

## Preparation

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

1.  [Fork and clone](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone)
    this repository.
1.  Install dependencies with `npm install`.


## Tasks

Developers should run these often!

-   `grunt nag` or just `grunt`: runs code quality analysis tools on your code
    and complains
-   `grunt reformat`: reformats all your code in a standard style
-   `grunt serve`: generates bundles, watches, and livereloads
-   `grunt test`: runs any automated tests, depends on `grunt build`
-   `grunt build`: place bundled styles and scripts where `index.html` can find
    them
